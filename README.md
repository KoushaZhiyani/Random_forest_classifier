# Random_forest_classifier
<H3>1. Imports necessary libraries:</H3>
 `pandas` for data manipulation, `train_test_split` from `sklearn.model_selection` for splitting the dataset, and `Random_Forest` class from the `random_forest` module for implementing a Random Forest model.
 
<H3>2. Reads the datase</H3>
Reads the dataset from a CSV file named "your file.csv" into a pandas DataFrame.
<H3>3. Splits the dataset</H3>
Splits the dataset into features (X) and the target variable (y).
<H3>4. Instantiates a Random Forest model</H3>
Instantiates a Random Forest model with specified parameters: 3 estimators (trees) and a maximum depth of 5 for each tree.
<H3>5. Adjust the parameters (optional)</H3>
four optional parameters: `n_estimators` , `max_depth` , `min_sample` and `split_size`. You can adjust these parameters according to your requirements to experiment with different configurations of the Random Forest model.
<H3>6. Trains the model</H3>
Trains the Random Forest model using the training sets.
<H3>7. Makes predictions</H3>
Makes predictions on the test set using the trained model.
<H3>8. Evaluates the model accuracy</H3>
Evaluates the model accuracy by comparing the predicted values with the actual values from the test set.
